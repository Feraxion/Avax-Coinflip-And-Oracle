# Avax-Coinflip-Oracle
A Coinflip project for Avalanche, using oracle for randomness on chain. 
Only oracle.js and smart contracts provided. 
It is not battle-tested in mainnet but we did have 2k+ flips in testnet with success.

If you want to check project out : avaxcoinflip.com (Flip is not working due to I decided to stop the project but it is still a cool site :) )
Released in testnet but did not make it into Mainnet due to market conditions.

Feel free to reach me if you want to discuss about it.
